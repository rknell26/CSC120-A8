- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
It represents a butterfly, which is created and given a name. The butterfly can land on items, figure out whether they are edible or not, and then either eat from them or leave them. The butterfly can walk and rest, and it can fly only when facing north. It gains weight from eating and loses weight from flying, and if its weight gets too small or too large, it dies. 
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I implemented the main() method as well as the Butterfly() method that creates an instance of the Butterfly class.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Implementing Contract.java and creating methods worked well. For a while I was confused about the return type Number, but I worked it out. I would recommend thinking through logically how you can create the outcome you want with the methods you are given.
